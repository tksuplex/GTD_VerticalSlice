# GTD_VerticalSlice
A rough vertical slice for an in-progress video game that I'm working on.

As of this posting I am the only person on Earth who has touched anything in this game and it's code.

I made the art, the buttons in photoshop, I made the music using ButtonBass.com and Audacity. 

There are still some glitches and work to be done, but I have worked harder on this than I have on anything and I want nothing more than to sleep forever.
